IP addresses are typically shown in dotted-decimal format (e.g., 192.0.2.1), but there are other ways to represent the same address, often used to evade detection.

Examples Using 8.8.8.8 (Google Public DNS):

Octal: 010.010.010.010 or 010101010.
Hexadecimal: 0x8080808 or segmented as 0x8.0x8.0x8.0x8.
Decimal: 134744072.
Binary: 00001000.00001000.00001000.00001000.
Encoded: %38%2E%38%2E%38%2E%38.
Mixed: 0x8.010.8.134744072.

Zero-Optimized Notation
For 10.0.0.1, variations include:
10.1
10.0000000001.

These representations are often accepted by browsers, allowing adversaries to hide malicious IPs and bypass detection systems.

Similarly, URL formats present significant challenges to content inspection systems. One common tactic involves using the @ character in URIs, creating deceptive URLs that lead to semantic attacks. For instance:

Simple Example: https://fake@bing.com resolves to bing.com, ignoring the “fake” part.
Multiple Iterations: https://fake@fake@fake@fake@bing.com also resolves to bing.com.
This method works with IP address variations as well:

Hexadecimal: https://test@0x2afac78e
Decimal: https://@721078158
Mixed: https://192.168.1@0x2afac78e
Camouflage Techniques
Attackers may mask malicious URLs behind seemingly benign ones:

https://example.com@malicioussite.com
https://localhost@bing.com
These methods exploit browser-supported formats, bypassing content inspection by disguising malicious intent. Although such attacks have been known for years, their effectiveness continues to pose a challenge.



## Example Redirect to Google.com (172.217.19.164 IP address):
DNS redirect: https://www.walmart.com@google.com
IP redirect: https://www.facebook.com@172.217.19.164
Decimal redirect: https://www.facebook.com@2899907492
Hex redirect: https://www.facebook.com@0xacd913a4
Octal redirect: https://www.facebook.com@025466211644
Binary redirect: https://www.facebook.com@10101100.11011001.00010011.10100100 (Not Working)
URL redirect: https://www.facebook.com@%3172%2E%3217%2E%319%2E%3164
