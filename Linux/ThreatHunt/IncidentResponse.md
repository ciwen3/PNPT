## Running the Script

To run the Incident Response Linux script, follow these steps:

1. Download the script from the repository.
2. Give the script executable permissions:
   ```
   chmod +x IRLinux_Script.sh
   ```
3. Execute the script with appropriate permissions (root permissions may be required for some commands):
   ```
   sudo ./IRLinux_Script.sh
   ```
4. Once the script completes its execution, the output will be saved in `/tmp/IRLinux.txt`.
5. You can view the output with a text editor or using a command like `cat` or `less`:
   ```
   less /tmp/IRLinux.txt
   ```

Note: Ensure that the script is run in a safe environment as it accesses system files and configurations. Modify the script as needed for your specific use case.
