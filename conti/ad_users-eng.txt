I'll tell you another moment about ad_users, there is a lot of information about employees, there you can find techies, engineers, etc. We usually need ad_users when we want to find the admin's wheelbarrow, because on the admin's wheelbarrows we can find flogs from the antivirus console, from cloud backups, etc. Now I will throw off the manual for YUZERHUNTER, with the help of it, we find these cars. We also need ad_users to get the SID from there for a golden ticket, but more on that later
1. make a list of targets
1.1 We open ad_users, we are looking for who we are potentially interested in: admin / engineer / inform technologists / IT
take account logins from sAMAccountName
1.2 We take a list of domain admins
1.3 put the first and second in the list.txt file

2. Load power view.
2.1 powershell-import _/home/user/soft/powerview/view.ps1_
2.1 --comment: importing power view from /home/user/soft/powerview/view.ps1

2.3 Cutting in hunting
2.3.1
psinject 1884 x64 Invoke-UserHunter -Threads 20 -UserFile C:\ProgramData\list.txt >> C:\ProgramData\out.txt

instead of 1884 - the PID of the process where we have enough rights to make an injection.
x64 - or x86 bit of the process. see in the tasklist
In c\programdata\sheet.txt there should be a list that we did in point # 1.
in 5-10-20 minutes watch the result in out.tht. As soon as it finishes, it replenishes it at once. that is, if the file is 0 bytes, it means that it works or the AV has burned (if you have burned it, then you will see it in the koba)
