# Metasploit Exploit Suggester

you must already have a session opened on your target
```
meterpreter > run post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester
```

### for improved usability:
1. set verbose true
2. set exitonsession false
3. use the "run_all_post" resource script
    https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/scripts/resource/run_all_post.rc
    ```
    # run_all_post.rc
    # Author: mubix
    
    # This is a sample resource script demonstrating a technique of running
    # a single post module against several active sessions at once. The post
    # module should be the currently active module, with sessions from other
    # modules already established via exploit -j or an equivalent.
    
    # Usage example
    # msf  exploit(psexec) > use post/windows/gather/checkvm 
    # msf  post(checkvm) > resource scripts/resource/run_all_post.rc 
    # [*] Processing scripts/resource/run_all_post.rc for ERB directives.
    # [*] resource (scripts/resource/run_all_post.rc)> Ruby Code (189 bytes)
    # SESSION => 1
    # [*] Running post/windows/gather/checkvm against session 1
    # [*] Checking if WIN2K3TARGET is a Virtual Machine .....
    # [*] This is a VMware Virtual Machine
    # [*] Post module execution completed
    # SESSION => 2
    # [*] Running post/windows/gather/checkvm against session 2
    # [*] Checking if WIN2K8TARGET is a Virtual Machine .....
    # [*] This is a VMware Virtual Machine
    # [*] Post module execution completed
    # msf  post(checkvm) >  
    
    <ruby>
        framework.sessions.each_key do |session|
        run_single("set SESSION #{session}")
	      print_status("Running #{active_module.fullname} against session #{session}")
	      run_single("run")
	      sleep 1
    end
    </ruby>
```
